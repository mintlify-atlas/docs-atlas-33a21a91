# Installation

Install zerobrew on macOS or Linux using the installation script.

## Prerequisites

The installer will check for and install the following if needed:

- `curl` - for downloading files
- `git` - for cloning the repository (source builds only)
- `cargo` and Rust toolchain (source builds only)

## Quick install

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the installation script">
    Download and execute the zerobrew installer:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://zerobrew.rs/install | bash
    ```

    The installer will:
    - Download the latest pre-built binaries for your platform (if available)
    - Fall back to building from source if pre-built binaries are unavailable
    - Install `zb` and `zbx` binaries to `~/.local/bin`
    - Set up environment variables and PATH configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your shell">
    After installation, run the `export` command that the installer prints, or restart your terminal:

    ```bash
    # Example output from installer
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    <Note>
    The installer automatically modifies your shell configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.) unless you use the `--no-modify-path` flag.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Check that zerobrew is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    zb --version
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation options

The installer supports several options for customization:

### Don't modify PATH

Prevent the installer from modifying your shell configuration files:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zerobrew.rs/install | bash -s -- --no-modify-path
```

### Install from local binaries

If you've already built zerobrew locally, you can install the binaries directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zerobrew.rs/install | bash -s -- --binary /path/to/zb /path/to/zbx
```

### View help

To see all available options:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zerobrew.rs/install | bash -s -- --help
```

## Installation directories

zerobrew uses the following directory structure:

| Directory | Purpose | Default Location |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `ZEROBREW_ROOT` | Root directory for zerobrew data | `/opt/zerobrew` (macOS)<br/>`$XDG_DATA_HOME/zerobrew` (Linux) |
| `ZEROBREW_PREFIX` | Symlink prefix for installed packages | Same as `ZEROBREW_ROOT` (macOS)<br/>`$ZEROBREW_ROOT/prefix` (Linux) |
| `ZEROBREW_BIN` | Binary installation directory | `$HOME/.local/bin` |
| `ZEROBREW_DIR` | Repository clone location | `$HOME/.zerobrew` |

<Tip>
On macOS, zerobrew uses the root directory directly as the prefix to maintain compatibility with Mach-O binary path length constraints (13 characters, same as `/opt/homebrew`).
</Tip>

## Supported platforms

Pre-built binaries are available for:

- **macOS**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon), x86_64 (Intel)
- **Linux**: ARM64, x86_64

If a pre-built binary isn't available for your platform, the installer will automatically fall back to building from source.

## Building from source

If you prefer to build from source or need a platform without pre-built binaries:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Rust">
    Install the Rust toolchain if you don't have it:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucasgelfond/zerobrew.git
    cd zerobrew
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the binaries">
    ```bash
    cargo build --release --bin zb --bin zbx
    ```

    The binaries will be available in `target/release/`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the binaries">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    cp target/release/zb target/release/zbx ~/.local/bin/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize zerobrew">
    ```bash
    zb init
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

If `zb` is not found after installation, ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add this line to your shell configuration file (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

### Build failures

If the source build fails, check that you have:

- A recent version of Rust (run `rustup update`)
- Required system libraries (the installer will guide you)

### Permission errors

<Warning>
Do not run the installer with `sudo`. The installer will automatically request privileges when needed for system directory access.
</Warning>
