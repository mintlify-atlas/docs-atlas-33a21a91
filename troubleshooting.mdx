## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-exclamation" title="Permission errors during installation">
    If you encounter permission errors when running `zb install`, this usually means zerobrew doesn't have write access to the installation directory.

    **Solution:**
    - Ensure you have proper permissions for the installation prefix
    - On macOS, zerobrew defaults to `/opt/zerobrew` to stay within the 13-character Mach-O path limit
    - You can customize the installation directory during setup
    - Avoid using `sudo` with zerobrew commands
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="link-slash" title="Symlink conflicts or bricked installs">
    You may encounter errors about symlink conflicts when installing packages.

    **Solution:**
    - zerobrew now prevents bricked installs from link conflicts and respects keg-only formulas
    - If you're experiencing this issue, make sure you're running the latest version of zerobrew
    - For keg-only formulas, zerobrew will not create symlinks in the main bin directory
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="download" title="Package download fails or hangs">
    Download issues can occur due to network problems or unavailable bottles.

    **Solution:**
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try again after a few minutes (the Homebrew API might be temporarily unavailable)
    - If no bottle is available for your platform, use the `--build-from-source` or `-s` flag:
      ```bash
      zb install <package> --build-from-source
      ```
    - This will compile the package from source locally
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Shell initialization issues">
    If zerobrew commands aren't recognized after installation, your shell may not be properly configured.

    **Solution:**
    - zerobrew should automatically configure your shell during installation
    - Supported shells: bash, zsh, and fish
    - Restart your terminal or run:
      ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc  # for bash
      source ~/.zshrc   # for zsh
      ```
    - For fish, run: `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="apple" title="macOS-specific: zbx-darwin-arm64 not found">
    On macOS ARM (M1/M2/M3), you might see an error about missing `zbx-darwin-arm64`.

    **Solution:**
    - This was fixed in recent releases where zbx binaries are now included
    - Update to the latest version of zerobrew
    - Run `zb update` or reinstall zerobrew from the latest release
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="wrench" title="Binary patching errors on macOS">
    Some packages may fail to install with errors related to binary patching.

    **Solution:**
    - zerobrew automatically patches Mach-O binaries to work with custom prefixes
    - Recent versions preserve the execute bit when patching
    - If the new prefix is longer than the old one, patching is skipped automatically
    - Ensure you're using the latest version of zerobrew
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="puzzle-piece" title="External taps or casks not working">
    Issues installing packages from external taps or cask formulas.

    **Solution:**
    - zerobrew now supports external taps and casks with safer install/uninstall behavior
    - Make sure you're running the latest version
    - For GitHub releases, zerobrew will attempt to install directly with a clone fallback
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gauge-high" title="Slow installation or performance issues">
    Installations taking longer than expected.

    **Solution:**
    - zerobrew is optimized for speed with parallel downloads and minimal overhead
    - Check your network connection speed
    - Clear the cache and try again: `zb cleanup`
    - Building from source will naturally take longer than installing bottles
  </Accordion>
