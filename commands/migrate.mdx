description: Migrate installed packages from Homebrew to zerobrew
---

The `zb migrate` command helps you transition from Homebrew to zerobrew by automatically installing your existing Homebrew packages using zerobrew, and optionally uninstalling them from Homebrew.

## When to Use

Use `zb migrate` when you:

- Want to switch from Homebrew to zerobrew for your existing packages
- Need to preserve your current development environment while gaining zerobrew's performance benefits
- Want to automatically handle package migration instead of reinstalling manually

<Note>
zerobrew is experimental. We recommend running it alongside Homebrew rather than as a replacement. Only core formulas from homebrew-core can be migrated.
</Note>

## Usage

```bash
zb migrate [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

<ParamField path="-y, --yes" type="flag">
  Skip confirmation prompts and proceed with migration automatically
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--force" type="flag">
  Pass `--force` to `brew uninstall` when removing packages from Homebrew (uninstalls even if other packages depend on them)
</ParamField>

## What Gets Migrated

The migration process handles different package types:

- **Core formulas** (from homebrew-core): ✅ Migrated to zerobrew
- **Non-core formulas** (from third-party taps): ⚠️ Skipped (not supported)
- **Casks** (GUI applications): ⚠️ Skipped (zerobrew only supports CLI tools)

## Migration Process

The command follows these steps:

1. **Discovery**: Scans your Homebrew installation for all installed packages
2. **Filtering**: Identifies which packages can be migrated (core formulas only)
3. **Confirmation**: Prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is used
4. **Installation**: Installs each formula using zerobrew
5. **Cleanup**: Optionally uninstalls successfully migrated formulas from Homebrew

## Examples

### Interactive Migration

Review packages and confirm before proceeding:

```bash
zb migrate
```

Output:
```
==> Fetching installed Homebrew packages...
    42 core formulas, 3 non-core formulas, 5 casks found

Note: Formulas from non-core taps cannot be migrated to zerobrew:
    • custom-tool (homebrew/custom)

Note: Casks cannot be migrated to zerobrew (only CLI formulas are supported):
    • visual-studio-code
    • firefox

The following 42 formulas will be migrated:
    • jq
    • wget
    • git
    ...

Continue with migration? [y/N]
```

### Non-Interactive Migration

Skip all prompts:

```bash
zb migrate --yes
```

### Force Uninstall from Homebrew

Use `--force` to uninstall packages from Homebrew even if they have dependents:

```bash
zb migrate --yes --force
```

<Warning>
Using `--force` may break other Homebrew packages that depend on the formulas being uninstalled.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

If some packages fail to install:

- Successful installations are tracked separately
- Failed packages remain in Homebrew
- Only successfully migrated packages are offered for Homebrew uninstallation
- A summary shows which packages failed and why

## Post-Migration

After migration:

- Successfully migrated packages are available via zerobrew
- Run `zb list` to see installed packages
- You can still use Homebrew for packages that couldn't be migrated
- Non-core formulas and casks remain in Homebrew
