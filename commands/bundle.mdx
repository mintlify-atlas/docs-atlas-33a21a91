description: "Install packages from or export packages to a Brewfile"
---

Manage package installations using Brewfiles, which are text files that list packages to install. This provides a declarative way to manage your development environment and makes it easy to reproduce setups across machines.

## Usage

```bash
zb bundle [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

## Subcommands

### install

Install packages from a Brewfile.

```bash
zb bundle install [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

<ParamField path="--file" type="path">
  Alias: `-f`
  
  Default: `Brewfile`
  
  Path to the Brewfile to read packages from.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--no-link" type="boolean">
  Install formulas but skip linking them into the prefix directory.
</ParamField>

### dump

Export currently installed packages to a Brewfile.

```bash
zb bundle dump [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

<ParamField path="--file" type="path">
  Alias: `-f`
  
  Default: `Brewfile`
  
  Path to write the Brewfile to.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--force" type="boolean">
  Overwrite the file if it already exists. Without this flag, `dump` will fail if the target file exists.
</ParamField>

## Global Options

<ParamField path="--root" type="path">
  Environment: `ZEROBREW_ROOT`
  
  Override the root directory for zerobrew's content-addressable store.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--prefix" type="path">
  Environment: `ZEROBREW_PREFIX`
  
  Override the prefix directory where packages are linked.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--concurrency" type="number">
  Default: `20`
  
  Number of concurrent operations to perform during installation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--auto-init" type="boolean">
  Alias: `--yes`
  
  Environment: `ZEROBREW_AUTO_INIT`
  
  Automatically initialize zerobrew if not already set up.
</ParamField>

## Brewfile Format

Brewfiles use a simple text format compatible with Homebrew:

```ruby
# Comments are supported
brew "jq"
brew "wget"
brew "git"

# Casks are supported
cask "docker-desktop"

# Taps are ignored by zerobrew
tap "homebrew/cask"

# Simple format also works
ripgrep
fd
```

**Syntax rules:**

- Lines starting with `#` are comments
- `brew "name"` - Install a formula
- `cask "name"` - Install a cask
- `tap "name"` - Ignored by zerobrew
- Plain package names are also supported
- Inline comments are supported: `jq # JSON processor`
- Duplicate entries are automatically deduplicated

## Examples

### Install from default Brewfile

Create a `Brewfile` in your current directory:

```ruby
brew "jq"
brew "wget"
brew "git"
```

Then install:

```bash
zb bundle
```

```
==> Installing 3 formulas from Brewfile...
==> Installing jq...
==> Resolving dependencies (1 packages)...
    jq 1.7.1
==> Downloading and installing formulas...
    jq               ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ✓ installed

==> Installed 1 packages in 2.45s
==> Installing wget...
...
==> Finished installing manifest in 15.32s
```

### Install from custom file

```bash
zb bundle install -f myfile
```

```
==> Installing 5 formulas from myfile...
...
```

### Export installed packages

```bash
zb bundle dump
```

```
==> Dumped 12 packages to Brewfile
```

Generated `Brewfile`:

```ruby
brew "jq"
brew "wget"
brew "git"
brew "openssl@3"
brew "pcre2"
brew "gettext"
brew "ripgrep"
brew "fd"
brew "bat"
brew "exa"
brew "httpie"
brew "tree"
```

### Dump to custom file

```bash
zb bundle dump -f ~/my-setup/Brewfile
```

```
==> Dumped 12 packages to /Users/username/my-setup/Brewfile
```

### Overwrite existing file

```bash
zb bundle dump --force
```

Without `--force`, if the file exists:

```
Error: file Brewfile already exists (use --force to overwrite)
```

### Install without linking

```bash
zb bundle install --no-link
```

All packages will be installed but not symlinked into your PATH.

## Workflow Examples

### Sync environment across machines

**On machine A:**

```bash
zb bundle dump
git add Brewfile
git commit -m "Update Brewfile"
git push
```

**On machine B:**

```bash
git pull
zb bundle install
```

### Project-specific dependencies

Add a `Brewfile` to your project repository:

```ruby
# Brewfile
brew "node"
brew "python@3.11"
brew "postgresql@15"
brew "redis"
```

Team members can install dependencies:

```bash
cd project
zb bundle install
```

### Environment profiles

Create different Brewfiles for different purposes:

```bash
zb bundle dump -f Brewfile.dev      # Development tools
zb bundle dump -f Brewfile.data     # Data science tools
zb bundle dump -f Brewfile.ops      # DevOps tools
```

Switch environments:

```bash
zb bundle install -f Brewfile.data
```

## Comparison with Homebrew

| Feature | zerobrew | Homebrew |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Install from Brewfile | `zb bundle` | `brew bundle` |
| Custom file | `zb bundle install -f FILE` | `brew bundle --file=FILE` |
| Export Brewfile | `zb bundle dump` | `brew bundle dump` |
| Force overwrite | `zb bundle dump --force` | `brew bundle dump --force` |
| No link | `zb bundle install --no-link` | Not available |

## Error Handling

### File not found

```bash
zb bundle install -f missing.txt
```

```
Error: failed to read manifest missing.txt: No such file or directory
```

### Empty Brewfile

If your Brewfile contains only comments:

```
Error: manifest Brewfile did not contain any formulas
```

### File exists (dump)

```bash
zb bundle dump
```

If `Brewfile` already exists:

```
Error: file Brewfile already exists (use --force to overwrite)
```

Use `--force` to overwrite:

```bash
zb bundle dump --force
```
