- **name** - The formula name (bold)
- **version** - The installed version (dimmed)

## Examples

### List installed packages

```bash
zb list
```

```
jq 1.7.1
wget 1.21.4
git 2.44.0
openssl@3 3.2.1
pcre2 10.43
gettext 0.22.5
```

### No packages installed

If you haven't installed any packages yet:

```bash
zb list
```

```
No formulas installed.
```

### After installing packages

```bash
zb install jq wget
zb list
```

```
jq 1.7.1
wget 1.21.4
openssl@3 3.2.1
```

Note that dependencies (like `openssl@3`) are also shown.

## Use Cases

### Check what's installed

Quickly see all packages managed by zerobrew:

```bash
zb list
```

### Export to Brewfile

Use `list` output to manually create a Brewfile, or use [`zb bundle dump`](/commands/bundle) to do it automatically:

```bash
zb bundle dump
```

### Count installed packages

```bash
zb list | wc -l
```

```
12
```

### Find specific package

```bash
zb list | grep node
```

```
node 21.6.2
```

### Script usage

Check if a package is installed in a script:

```bash
if zb list | grep -q "^jq "; then
  echo "jq is installed"
else
  echo "jq is not installed"
  zb install jq
fi
```

## Implementation Details

The `list` command reads from zerobrew's local installation database, which tracks:

- Formula name
- Installed version
- Store key (content-addressable hash)
- Installation timestamp
- Link status

For more detailed information about a specific package, use [`zb info`](/commands/info).

## Comparison with Homebrew

| Feature | zerobrew | Homebrew |
|---------|----------|----------|
| List installed | `zb list` | `brew list` |
| Output format | name + version | name only (or verbose) |
| Show dependencies | Yes | With `--formula` |
| Machine-readable | Output is parseable | Use `brew list --json` |

## Performance

The `list` command is instant, as it reads from a local SQLite database rather than scanning the filesystem:

```bash
time zb list > /dev/null
```

```
0.01s user 0.00s system 95% cpu 0.012 total
```
