title: "zb install"
description: "Install one or more packages from Homebrew"
---

Installs one or more formulas from Homebrew, with support for pre-built bottles and source builds.

## Usage

```bash
zb install <FORMULAS>... [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="FORMULAS" type="string[]" required>
  One or more formula names to install. Supports regular formulas and casks (prefixed with `cask:`).
  
  Examples: `jq`, `wget`, `git`, `cask:docker-desktop`
</ParamField>

## Options

<ParamField path="--no-link" type="boolean">
  Install the formula but skip linking it into the prefix directory. The formula will be installed in the store but won't be available in your PATH.
  
  Useful when you want to install a formula without making it immediately available.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--build-from-source" type="boolean">
  Alias: `-s`
  
  Build the formula from source instead of using pre-built bottles. This compiles the package locally using Homebrew's Ruby DSL.
  
  Note: Source builds take significantly longer than installing bottles.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--root" type="path">
  Environment: `ZEROBREW_ROOT`
  
  Override the root directory for zerobrew's content-addressable store.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--prefix" type="path">
  Environment: `ZEROBREW_PREFIX`
  
  Override the prefix directory where packages are linked.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--concurrency" type="number">
  Default: `20`
  
  Number of concurrent operations to perform during installation. Must be at least 1.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--auto-init" type="boolean">
  Alias: `--yes`
  
  Environment: `ZEROBREW_AUTO_INIT`
  
  Automatically initialize zerobrew if not already set up.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Install a single package

```bash
zb install jq
```

```
==> Installing jq...
==> Resolving dependencies (1 packages)...
    jq 1.7.1
==> Downloading and installing formulas...
    jq               ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   1.2MB/1.2MB   done

==> Installed 1 packages in 2.45s
```

### Install multiple packages

```bash
zb install wget git
```

```
==> Installing wget, git...
==> Resolving dependencies (5 packages)...
    wget 1.21.4
    git 2.44.0
    openssl@3 3.2.1
    pcre2 10.43
    gettext 0.22.5
==> Downloading and installing formulas...

==> Installed 5 packages in 8.32s
```

### Install without linking

```bash
zb install jq --no-link
```

The formula will be installed in the store but won't be symlinked into your PATH. You can still run it using `zbx jq`.

### Build from source

```bash
zb install libsodium --build-from-source
```

```
==> Installing libsodium...
==> Resolving dependencies (1 packages)...
    libsodium 1.0.19
==> Downloading and installing formulas...
    libsodium        unpacking...

==> Installed 1 packages in 45.20s
```

### Install a cask

```bash
zb install cask:docker-desktop
```

## Performance

zerobrew uses several optimizations to speed up installations:

- **Content-addressable storage**: Shared dependencies are deduplicated
- **APFS clonefiles**: Zero-overhead copying on compatible filesystems
- **Concurrent downloads**: Multiple packages downloaded in parallel
- **Warm cache**: Previously downloaded bottles are reused

Typical speedups compared to Homebrew:
- **Cold cache** (first install): 2-4x faster
- **Warm cache** (reinstall): 7-30x faster

## Error Handling

### Link conflicts

If a file already exists in the prefix directory, zerobrew will report a link conflict:

```
Error: The link step did not complete successfully.
The formula was installed, but is not symlinked into the prefix.

Possible conflicting files:
  /usr/local/bin/jq (symlink belonging to homebrew)
```

You can resolve this by:
1. Uninstalling the conflicting package with Homebrew
2. Using `--no-link` and running with `zbx` instead
3. Manually removing the conflicting symlink

### Formula not found

If a formula doesn't exist or isn't supported:

```
Error: Formula 'nonexistent' not found in homebrew-core

Try using Homebrew directly:
  brew install nonexistent
```
