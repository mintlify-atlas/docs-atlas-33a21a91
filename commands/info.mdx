## Examples

### Get info for an installed package

```bash
zb info jq
```

```
Name:       jq
Version:    1.7.1
Store key:  a3f5d8c9b2e1
Installed:  2024-03-15 14:32 (15 minutes ago)
```

### Package installed days ago

```bash
zb info git
```

```
Name:       git
Version:    2.44.0
Store key:  7c2b9a1d4e6f
Installed:  2024-03-10 (5 days ago)
```

### Package installed hours ago

```bash
zb info wget
```

```
Name:       wget
Version:    1.21.4
Store key:  e8d7c6b5a4f3
Installed:  2024-03-15 09:20 (5 hours ago)
```

### Package not installed

```bash
zb info nonexistent
```

```
Formula 'nonexistent' is not installed.
```

## Use Cases

### Check installation time

Find out when a package was installed:

```bash
zb info node
```

### Verify package version

Confirm which version of a package is installed:

```bash
zb info python@3.11
```

### Debug installation issues

The store key can help identify whether a package is correctly installed in the content-addressable store:

```bash
zb info problematic-package
```

If the package appears in `zb list` but not in `zb info`, there may be a database inconsistency.

### Script integration

Check if a package is installed and get its version:

```bash
if zb info jq &>/dev/null; then
  echo "jq is installed"
  zb info jq | grep Version:
else
  echo "jq is not installed"
  zb install jq
fi
```

## Understanding Store Keys

The store key is the first 12 characters of the SHA-256 hash that identifies the package in zerobrew's content-addressable store.

**Key properties:**

- **Content-addressable**: The same package with the same version and dependencies will always have the same store key
- **Deduplication**: Multiple formulas that depend on the same package share the same store entry
- **Integrity**: The store key ensures package integrity

**Store location:**

```bash
$ZEROBREW_ROOT/store/objects/<full-hash>/
```

The full 64-character hash is stored in zerobrew's database, but only the first 12 characters are displayed for readability.

## Comparison with Homebrew

| Feature | zerobrew | Homebrew |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Package info | `zb info <formula>` | `brew info <formula>` |
| Shows installed version | Yes | Yes |
| Shows available version | No | Yes |
| Shows dependencies | No | Yes |
| Shows installation time | Yes | No (requires `brew list --versions`) |
| Shows store location | Via store key | Via `brew --prefix <formula>` |

For more comprehensive package information (including available updates), Homebrew's `brew info` provides additional details like homepage, description, and dependencies. zerobrew's `info` focuses on installation metadata.
