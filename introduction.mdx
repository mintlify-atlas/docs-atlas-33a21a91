# zerobrew

zerobrew is a fast Homebrew-compatible package installer written in Rust that brings uv-style architecture to Homebrew packages on macOS and Linux.

## Why zerobrew?

zerobrew is more of a performance-optimized client for the Homebrew ecosystem. It relies on Homebrew's formula definitions, pre-built bottles, and package infrastructure while providing significant performance improvements through:

- **Content-addressable storage** for deduplication
- **APFS clonefiles** for zero-overhead copying on macOS
- **Source build fallback** using Homebrew's Ruby DSL
- **Parallel downloads** and installations

## Performance snapshot

| Package | Homebrew | ZB (cold) | ZB (warm) | Cold Speedup | Warm Speedup |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Overall (top 100)** | 452s | 226s | 59s | **2.0x** | **7.6x** |
| ffmpeg | 3034ms | 3481ms | 688ms | 0.9x | 4.4x |
| libsodium | 2353ms | 392ms | 130ms | 6.0x | 18.1x |
| sqlite | 2876ms | 625ms | 159ms | 4.6x | 18.1x |
| tesseract | 18950ms | 5536ms | 643ms | 3.4x | 29.5x |

<Note>
zerobrew is experimental. We recommend running it alongside Homebrew rather than as a replacement, and do not recommend purging Homebrew unless you are absolutely sure about the implications.
