description: Use Brewfiles to manage and reproduce your package installations
---

Brewfiles are text files that list packages to install, similar to `package.json` for Node.js or `requirements.txt` for Python. zerobrew provides commands to install packages from Brewfiles and export your installed packages to a Brewfile.

## Installing from a Brewfile

### Default Brewfile

To install all packages listed in a `Brewfile` in the current directory:

```bash
zb bundle
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
zb bundle install
```

This reads the `Brewfile` and installs each package sequentially:

```
==> Installing 5 formulas from Brewfile...
==> Installing jq...
==> Installing wget...
==> Finished installing manifest in 12.34s
```

### Custom file location

To install from a different file:

```bash
zb bundle install -f packages.txt
zb bundle install --file ~/my-setup/Brewfile
```

### Install without linking

To install packages without creating symlinks in the prefix:

```bash
zb bundle install --no-link
```

This is useful if you want to install packages but not add them to your PATH.

## Brewfile Format

Brewfiles support multiple formats:

### Simple format

List one package per line:

```
jq
wget
git
sqlite
```

### Homebrew format

Use `brew` directives with quotes:

```ruby
brew "jq"
brew "wget"
brew "git"
brew "sqlite"
```

### Comments

Add comments with `#`:

```ruby
# Development tools
brew "jq"    # JSON processor
brew "wget"  # File downloader

# Version control
brew "git"
```

### Mixed format

Combine formats in the same file:

```ruby
# Can mix and match
brew "jq"
wget
git  # inline comments work everywhere
brew "sqlite"
```

### Tap and Cask directives

```ruby
tap "homebrew/core"        # Ignored by zerobrew
brew "jq"
cask "docker"              # Prefixed as cask:docker
```

<Warning>
`tap` directives are ignored since zerobrew always uses `homebrew-core`. Cask entries are supported but functionality may be limited compared to CLI formulas.
</Warning>

## Exporting to a Brewfile

### Default export

To export all installed packages to a `Brewfile` in the current directory:

```bash
zb bundle dump
```

Output:

```
==> Dumped 15 packages to Brewfile
```

The generated Brewfile uses the `brew` directive format:

```ruby
brew "git"
brew "jq"
brew "sqlite"
brew "wget"
```

### Custom output file

To dump to a different file:

```bash
zb bundle dump -f my-packages.txt
zb bundle dump --file ~/backups/Brewfile.2026-02-28
```

### Overwrite existing files

By default, `dump` will fail if the target file exists:

```
Error: file Brewfile already exists (use --force to overwrite)
```

To overwrite:

```bash
zb bundle dump --force
zb bundle dump -f output.txt --force
```

## Common Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a portable development environment">
    Export your current setup:

    ```bash
    zb bundle dump -f ~/dotfiles/Brewfile
    ```

    Commit to version control:

    ```bash
    cd ~/dotfiles
    git add Brewfile
    git commit -m "Add package manifest"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restore on a new machine">
    Clone your dotfiles:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/user/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ```

    Install all packages:

    ```bash
    zb bundle install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Team development environment

Create a shared Brewfile for your project:

```ruby title="Brewfile"
# Project dependencies
brew "jq"           # JSON parsing in scripts
brew "sqlite"       # Local database
brew "git"

# Development tools
brew "ripgrep"      # Fast code search
brew "fzf"          # Fuzzy finder
```

Team members can install:

```bash
zb bundle install
```

### Update and sync

After installing new packages, update your Brewfile:

```bash
zb install ripgrep fzf
zb bundle dump --force  # Update Brewfile
git add Brewfile
git commit -m "Add ripgrep and fzf"
```

## Brewfile Parsing Details

### Duplicate handling

Duplicate entries are automatically deduplicated:

```ruby
brew "jq"
brew "wget"
brew "jq"    # This duplicate is ignored
```

Result: Only `jq` and `wget` are installed (jq appears once).

### Empty lines and whitespace

Empty lines and leading/trailing whitespace are ignored:

```ruby

brew "jq"
   wget   

git
```

This is parsed as: `jq`, `wget`, `git`.

### Error handling

If the Brewfile contains only comments or is empty:

```
Error: manifest Brewfile did not contain any formulas
```

If the file doesn't exist:

```
Error: failed to read manifest Brewfile: No such file or directory
```
