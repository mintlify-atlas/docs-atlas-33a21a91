title: Migrating from Homebrew
description: Step-by-step guide to migrate your packages from Homebrew to zerobrew
---

The `zb migrate` command automates the migration of your Homebrew packages to zerobrew. This process identifies your installed Homebrew formulas, installs them using zerobrew, and optionally removes them from Homebrew.

## Before You Start

<Warning>
zerobrew is experimental. We recommend running it **alongside Homebrew** rather than as a replacement. Do not purge Homebrew unless you are absolutely sure about the implications.
</Warning>

zerobrew can migrate:
- Core formulas from `homebrew-core`

zerobrew **cannot** migrate:
- Formulas from non-core taps (third-party repositories)
- Casks (GUI applications)

## Migration Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the migrate command">
    Execute the migration command to scan your Homebrew installation:

    ```bash
    zb migrate
    ```

    This will display all detected packages:

    ```
    ==> Fetching installed Homebrew packages...
        24 core formulas, 3 non-core formulas, 5 casks found

    Note: Formulas from non-core taps cannot be migrated to zerobrew:
        • custom-tool (myuser/tap)
        • special-formula (company/internal)

    Note: Casks cannot be migrated to zerobrew (only CLI formulas are supported):
        • docker
        • visual-studio-code
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the migration plan">
    The command will list all core formulas that can be migrated:

    ```
    The following 24 formulas will be migrated:
        • jq
        • wget
        • git
        • sqlite
        ...
    ```

    You'll be prompted to continue:

    ```
    Continue with migration? [y/N]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install packages with zerobrew">
    After confirmation, zerobrew will install each formula:

    ```
    ==> Migrating 24 formulas to zerobrew...
        ○ jq... ✓
        ○ wget... ✓
        ○ git... ✓
    ```

    If any packages fail to install, they'll be listed at the end:

    ```
    Warning: Failed to migrate 2 formula(s):
        • package-name
        • another-package
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Uninstall from Homebrew (optional)">
    After successful migration, you'll be prompted to uninstall the formulas from Homebrew:

    ```
    Uninstall 22 formula(s) from Homebrew? [y/N]
    ```

    If you confirm, zerobrew will run `brew uninstall` for each successfully migrated package:

    ```
    ==> Uninstalling from Homebrew...
        ○ jq... ✓
        ○ wget... ✓
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Command Options

### Skip prompts with `-y`

To automatically accept all prompts, use the `-y` or `--yes` flag:

```bash
zb migrate -y
```

This will:
1. Automatically proceed with migration
2. Automatically uninstall migrated packages from Homebrew

### Force uninstall with `--force`

If packages have dependents in Homebrew, the uninstall step may fail. Use `--force` to ignore dependencies:

```bash
zb migrate --force
```

This passes the `--force` flag to `brew uninstall`, removing packages even if other Homebrew formulas depend on them.

<Warning>
Using `--force` may break Homebrew packages that depend on the uninstalled formulas. Only use this if you're removing all Homebrew packages or understand the dependency implications.
</Warning>

### Combine options

```bash
zb migrate -y --force
```

## After Migration

Once migration is complete:

1. Verify your packages work correctly:
   ```bash
   zb list
   jq --version
   wget --version
   ```

2. Non-core formulas and casks remain in Homebrew and will continue to work

3. You can continue using both zerobrew and Homebrew side-by-side

## Troubleshooting

### Package fails to migrate

If a package fails during migration:

1. Check the error message for details
2. Try installing it manually:
   ```bash
   zb install package-name
   ```
3. If it still fails, the package may not be fully supported yet

### Homebrew uninstall fails

If uninstall from Homebrew fails:

```bash
brew uninstall --force package-name
```

Or keep it in Homebrew if other packages depend on it.
